**Why am I doing this?**

After I wrote that email to somebody to explain c++, I discovered a new study technique!
By trying to explain that subject in a way I thought made sense to someone who didn't know it, I ended up understanding the material way better than before.
So in preparation for my Computer Science class, I'm going explain all the topics we have learned in class so far to you reader under the assumption that you don't already know it!
You don't have to read everything, but I figure this is a good way to study and keep myself on track!
Also if there are any mistakes feel free to let me know.
Keep in mind I'm writing this as if you have little to no knowledge on the topics; someone who has only taken introductionary Computer Science clas, but don't be offended dear reader
The way I'm going to structure it is in two parts.
The first part defines and explains why this is a thing, and the second part will show how to actually implement it in code.
